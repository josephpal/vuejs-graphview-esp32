# GraphView

GraphView is a simple example to plot and receive data via a websocket connection from a ESP32 micro-controller running a c++ backend. As a graphical example i choose to let the ESP32 compute the [*Mandelbrot*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) fractal via single and dual core processing. The result will be visible on the canvas view port, while the execution time results, which we want to compare, are shown in the graphs.

As a second example, i have chosen to compute a simple sum in parallel using multiple threads running on each core. For more information, please visit the [repository](https://github.com/josephpal/esp32-BasicParallelProcessing) on which the described problem is based on.

## Demo

The backend, which is running on the ESP32 to perform the computation, is based on one of my other repositories and can be found [here](https://github.com/josephpal/esp32-ParallelProgramming).
